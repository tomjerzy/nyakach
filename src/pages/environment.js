      slowly but surely become more and more efficient. These incremental changes in how we 
      power our day-to-day lives have a dramatic domino effect in the long run. But replacing a

    description:
      `
      Although our world is becoming more energy-dependent as life becomes digitized, 
      our ways of producing energy are becoming cleaner. Of course, thereâ€™s one major 
      reason why: renewable energy systems. As we learn to harness the power of the sun, 
      wind and water, our dependence on power sources that are exhaustible and produce pollution is 
      reduced year by year.`,

      `
      Renewable energy production allows us to rely less on fossil fuels 
      and other types of pollutants. Technological advances in clean energy 
      systems are one of the biggest reasons why they have become a more 
      efficient and economically viable option for individuals and corporations alike. For example, 
      solar power production is now 73% cheaper than it was in 2006`,

      Our ways of farming are becoming less harmful to the environment as we 
      begin to understand how our actions affect surrounding ecosystems. 
      Farms using modern agricultural methods can produce as much as 10 times more crops from the 
      same amount of land when compared with past methods.`,

    description:
      `
As recycling technology develops, we can more effectively recycle and reuse more of our waste. 
In the future, humans may be able to create a 100% closed loop system by recycling the majority of 
the materials we use. This would be one of the most significant advancements for the planet as the 
lifecycle of something as simple as a water bottle can lead to resource depletion, industrial waste, 
air and water pollution, habitat erosion, animal extinction and more.`,

      Cities are often looked at as central hubs for pollution and energy consumption, 
      but this idea is slowly becoming less true. An entire division of technology is purely 
      dedicated to reducing pollutants from our daily activities. Toward the end of the last 
      century, this technology has helped 
      prevent an incredible amount of harm to our planet.`,

      the planet we live on. Technology is a massive part of this equation. As people have greater

      more people can realize their impact and find ways to combat it.`,

        We only have one planet on which we live. The planet is full of resources, some renewable and some not, 
        but unfortunately, we have an ever-growing population that poses a huge threat to all these resources. 
        It is therefore unclear what future generations will find, if ever, and what life will be like for them 
        if we exploit all the current resources. To fix this issue as well as ensure we leave some resources for 
        the future, 
        environmental conservation comes in and this article will delve more into the topic.
